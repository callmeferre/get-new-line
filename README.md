[![made with C](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-c.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)


This project allows to read an available text one line at a time until the end of it. It returns the line that has just been read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error has occurred it returns NULL. <br>
In *get_next_line_utils.c* there are the functions from [Libft][1] relevant to this project.
